## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more information about testing, check [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you need to modify the build configurations, you can "eject".  
Note that this is a one-way operation.

## Development

Make sure you have the latest version of `npm` installed.

To start development, simply run:
```bash
npm start
```
Then open the project URL in your browser:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Run tests

To run tests in the watch mode:
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

For production deployment, run the build process:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production files. You can host it with a static file server.
